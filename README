You'll need PLT Scheme 4, GNU Make, GNU bash, GNU m4, gnuplot, patched
texdepend and modern TeX distribution (TeX Live 2008 is ok) to «build»
this paper.

texdepend patch which allows using of several additional characters in
`\input` commands is available from the author of this paper.

As of December 2008, patching of pgfplots package for TeX is needed
for this paper to compile successfully, see
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.tex.pgf.user/2082

Scheme pyani-lib for PLT is available here:
